This channel is for discussion about the community's discord bot: @The Hangout Bot (a.k.a Jeremy). The bot is publicly available on GitHub: https://github.com/BenWomble/TheHangoutBot. We also want you to contribute and add commands to the bot if you are up to the task.

JavaScript
First off, the bot is written in JavaScript. Get started by learning it, a great resource is Code Academy: https://www.codecademy.com/learn/introduction-to-javascript. Also, W3Schools and Khan Academy are useful learning resources.

Discord.js
Next, learn discord.js. They actually have a really nice guide that teaches you how to setup node.js here: https://discordjs.guide/#before-you-begin. discord.js.org also gives a lot of information regarding specific objects and attributes: https://discord.js.org/. For help with specific problems join the discord.js server: https://discord.gg/djs.

GitHub
Next you are going to want to understand and explore the GitHub repository. GitHub stores and manages our code making it easy for us to collaborate. I great place to start learning is https://guides.github.com/. After you have an understanding of GitHub and JavaScript, explore the code base (especially the README file and the TEMPLATES folder for command templates: https://github.com/BenWomble/TheHangoutBot. Then fork the project and start writing pull requests!

Finally, contribute! Find a command our system you want to implement into the bot here: https://github.com/BenWomble/TheHangoutBot/projects/1. Then, fork the branch and setup an environment to start coding! More information on how to fork and setup an environment here: https://github.com/BenWomble/TheHangoutBot/blob/main/README.md. After you finish writing some code, create a pull request and wait for the code to be added!
