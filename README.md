# Important information


# How can I contribute?

 - Make sure you know python, pycord, and wavelink/Lavalink. More information [here](https://docs.pycord.dev/en/stable/index.html).
 - Next, fork the project following [this guide](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo).
 - Make sure to set up [pycord](https://docs.pycord.dev/en/stable/index.html) and [Git](https://git-scm.com/) during this step.
 - Also, run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the required packages after you clone.
 - Then, write some code or modify the existing code and push your changes to your fork of the repository.

> How to push code to a repository:
> 1. `git add .`
> 2. `git commit -m "BRIEF CHANGELOG HERE"`
> 3. `git push`

 - And create a [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request).

# How can I test my fork?
I have set up a testing bot with **very** limited permissions in the server for testing purposes. In your project folder create a file named `.env` and write the following line in it (use token from [this message](https://discord.com/developers/applications)): `TOKEN=TOKENFROMMESSAGE` and save the file. When you go to run your code (`python3 main.py`), the testing bot should come online and will be running your code on your computer.
